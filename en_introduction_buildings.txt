Welcome to the introduction to the ETS Information and Telecommunication Engineering site plan! ETSIIT is shaped like a triangle and can be divided into three areas. 
The first is Building A, which you probably entered first. Here you will find mainly the common areas, such as the cafeteria and the library, but also the administrative offices. 
The second building is Building B, which you will reach by following the corridor from Building A into the higher building connected to it. This is where all the teaching takes place. You will find almost all classrooms and labs here.
The third, easily recognizable area are the two containers you can see from the corridor. The one on the left is Module A and the one on the right is Module B.
There are restrooms in all buildings. However, if you can't find them, the friendly Etsiit students will surely help you.
